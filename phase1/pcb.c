* Process Control Block (PCB) Management
* 
* This module manages the allocation, deallocation, and organization of Process
* Control Blocks (PCBs). It supports PCB queue management, tree-based
* parent-child relationships, and general PCB operations.
* 
* The free PCB list is implemented as a singly linked list. The process queue
* is implemented as a doubly-linked list. The process tree is implemented as
* a tree of parent pointing to the first child, with this child and its
* siblings being connected through a doubly-linked list.
